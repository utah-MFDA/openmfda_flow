Plan from grant proposal is focusing on 2d layered P&R:
1. Folded ribbon - create a wide thin die area, then fold it back and forth like an accordion.
2. Hypergraph partitioning used for separating into subcircuits for layers. use pin constraints at top and bottom (automating pin placement a concern). Also interested in the application to lego stacked devices.
3. Combining valves and components into banks to leverage height. Synthesis for valve clustering.

Evaluating different PNR algorithms from the literature to find the most effective algorithm at different device complexities.

Next interests:
Biomedical semantic languages.
Lab procedure extraction (Check with Morteza on his datasheet extraction)

Timeline types for tracking scheduling constraints (Vishay in CS).
